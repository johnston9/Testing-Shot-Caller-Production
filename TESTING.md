## User Stories Testing
Note: Functional aspects of some User Stories are covered in the Features Testing section. [Features](#features-testing)

### First Time User Goals

1. #### As a First Time User, I want to learn what the site has to offer and how to navigate the site quickly.

    - The Landing/Home page is split into three sections. The first informs the user as to the nature of the site and what it offers, an "All in One" Film, TV and Video Production Software platform and "Budgeting Software" as a individual product.<br>
    It then lists the software's features under the Creative and the Production side headings. These can be clicked on to take the user quickly to the information page for that feature.<br>
    The second section gives a brief easy to understand overview of what the software does and what it can be used for.<br>
    At the top of every page the Navbar displays all options for the user so they can select their desired destination quickly.<br>

4. #### As a Returning User, I want purchase products easily.

    - Once the user has Registered whenever they login their My Account link will display in the Navbar. On going to their Account page the user will immediately see the "Create Project" and "Create Budget" features with a brief summary of each product above it. <br> It also contains a concise explanation of what happens when a product is created and how the user should proceed.
    <br>The Create Project is for the "All in One Platform" and the user can choose which version, the Film, TV or Video/Short production software, best suits their project using the summary above to guide them. The Create Budget is for the Budgeting software. Both the Projects and Budgets will have a discounted student version and the Projects have a one month free trial both of which are designed to create more sales.<br>
    Once the user selects a product they will be taken to the Stripe page to complete the transaction. And once the sale goes through the user will receive an email confirming the purchase and containing the project details. These detail include the Project URL and the user's username and password.<br>
    Lastly the project or Budget will now display on the user's account page with its URL. See Features Testing for more.
