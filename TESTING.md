    The second section gives a brief easy to understand overview of what the software does and what it can be used for.<br>
    The site is designed for first time learning. It is streamlined for specific user goal that upon first use the user with a clicks will be able to find all information about the software's features. At the top of every page the Navbar displays all options for the user so they can select their desired destination quickly.

### Returning User Goals

1. #### As a Returning User, I want to easily login and logout.

    - The user can login and logout easily from the My Account nav link. The login takes them to Sign In page and the logout is automatic. <br>
    The site also includes a feature that keeps a user signed in for 24 hours so they don't have to go to the trouble of signing in if they are using it regularly. This is achieved by an interceptor function in the CurrentUserContext file that checks, via the utils folder shouldRefreshToken function, if there is a vaild timestamp token in local storage and refreshes it.

    - Once the user has Registered whenever they login their My Account link will display in the Navbar. On going to their Account page the user will immediately see the "Create Project" and "Create Budget" features with a brief summary of each product above it. <br> It also contains a concise explanation of what happens when a product is created and how the user should proceed.
    <br>The Create Project is for the "All in One Platform" and the user can choose which version, the Film, TV or Video/Short production software, best suits their project using the summary above to guide them. The Create Budget is for the Budgeting software. Both the Projects and Budgets will have a discounted student version and the Projects have a one month free trial both of which are designed to create more sales.<br>
    Once the user selects a product they will be taken to the Stripe page to complete the transaction. And once the sale goes through the user will receive an email confirming the purchase and containing the project details. These detail include the Project URL and the user's username and password.<br>
