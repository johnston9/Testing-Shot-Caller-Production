    The site also includes a feature that keeps a user signed in for 24 hours so they don't have to go to the trouble of signing in if they are using it regularly. This is achieved by an interceptor function in the CurrentUserContext file that checks, via the utils folder shouldRefreshToken function, if there is a vaild timestamp token in local storage and refreshes it.

    <br>The Create Project is for the "All in One Platform" and the user can choose which version, the Film, TV or Video/Short production software, best suits their project using the summary above to guide them. The Create Budget is for the Budgeting software. Both the Projects and Budgets will have a discounted student version and the Projects have a one month free trial both of which are designed to create more sales.<br>
    Once the user selects a product they will be taken to the Stripe page to complete the transaction. And once the sale goes through the user will receive an email confirming the purchase and containing the project details. These detail include the Project URL and the user's username and password.<br>
