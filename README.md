<h1 align="center"><strong>Shot Caller Production</strong></h1>

[View the project live here.](https://)

A web application for film, TV and video production.<br>

## Purpose
Essentially the site consists of three elements. The first to introduce the user to its two software products, an "All in One Film, TV, and Video Production Platform" and "Budgeting Software". This element aims to give them about them clear information about the products and encourage them to create an account and purchase them. The second contains the user's account page which allows them to purchase products and view their already purchased ones easily. The third is the actual Budgeting Software. This is available as a separate product but is also included as part of the "All in One Platform".
<br>

## Usage
To use the site to gather information the user can click on any link in the Home page or Navbar to take them to that feature's information page. <br>
To use the site to view and purchase products the User first creates an account by clicking on any of the Register links then on their Account page they can select and purchase products and view all their already purchased products.<br>
Once a user has purchased an "All in One Platform" they will be given a URL, by email, connecting them to a separate application where the actual software is held along with a username and password for it. The product will also now show in their account page along with the URL to the platform and a separate link to the product's Budgeting software.<br>
If a user just purchases the Budgeting software they will also receive a URL, by email, for it along with a username and password for it and the product will also now show in their account page along with the URL to it.<br>
More detailed information about the features of this site and how to use it can be found in the [Existing Features section](#existing-features---usage-and-testing)
<br>
To use the "Budgeting Software" the user simply clicks on the link to be taken to it and there they will find information on how to use it.<br>
There is no installation needed or requirements for the "All in One Platform" or "Budgeting Software" for the App.<br>
Here is the link to that Platform App's Readme. [Shot Caller](https://)<br>

## User Experience (UX)

The business goals are to establish the app as a professional film production software platform, to create an online presence and establish it as a brand. Its primary purpose is to entice new customer to register and purchase products and secure regular returning customers. It aims initially to catch the user's attention by making an immediate impact on them as to the nature of the software and create curiosity with the user to encourage them to explore the software's features. It aims to build trust and ultimately inspire them to create an account and purchase products. It aspires to build a customer base.

For the user, the initial goal of the site is to find out about the software and register an account easily. The Home page contains a brief overview of the software's abilities by section, i.e. the different aspects of film production that it facilitates. Each section when clicked on opens a page detailing and explaining that section with images.<br>
For the registered user the goal is to access their Account page to create projects easily by purchasing them and view their purchase products. For the user who has purchased the seperate "Budgeting Software" the goal is for them to understand how to use it as quickly as possible and to make using it a clear productive process.

### Strategy Plane

The aim of the site is to introduce Shot Caller Production to its potential customers.

It aims to create a brand to establish an image in the public eye for the platform, to immediately impact on them the use and quality of the product. Its simple design, clear navigation and easily understood sections aims to encourage customers to explore it's features fully, then create an account and to purchase it's products.

The site aims to, build a relationship with the user through its clear and obvious inherent professional knowledge of the film making process. Making this even clearer by its breaking down of the process into two sides, the Creative side and the Production side.<br>
One major strategic move was to separate the Budgeting software available as part of the platform into an individual product. This idea being that user would more readily open to purchase this very necessary tool and seeing its quality be more open to trusting the All in One Platform.

#### Brand Identity
- Brand promise: A complete film production software platform.
- Vision: Professional Creativity.
- Mission: To combine the creative and production sides of filmmaking in one all-encompassing platform.
- Values: Professional, Creative and Easy to Use.

### Login/Register/Logout Pages and Security

  The user can browse and view the features on the site but they are encouraged to create an account. They can do this or login or logout easily from My Account in the Navbar. There are also a number of other links to register, one being on the Home page, and on doing so the user is brought to the Register page which has a personal easy to use feel.<br>
  
  Django Rest Frameworks is used for the backend and has its own register and login features. These include its inbuilt security measures concerning for registering and logging in and out. it also deals with all other issues like changing and forgetting passwords.<br>
  See [Django Rest Frameworks](documentation/drf) for all Django Rest Frameworks images and testing images.

<p align="center"> <strong>Large Screen</strong></p>
<h2 align="center">
<img src="documentation/readme-images/home6.png" width="90%">
</h2>

  The site has a number of other security measures firstly the use of front end measures to prevent unauthorised users form accessing pages they do not have permission to, mainly other user's account pages. <br>
  <br>
  This is achieved firstly in the Front End by an interceptor function in the CurrentUserContext file that checks on each request, via the utils folder shouldRefreshToken function, if there is a valid timestamp token in local storage and refreshes it. If not it takes the user to the Sign In page.
  Secondly in the DRF backend the views have also a security check to check if the user is authorised to access each page or component.

### The Home Page

  This page is intended to primarily sell the product and is divided in three sections. First the landing page image which has links to the different information pages and a register link. Secondly a bullet point section giving an overview of the app. The last section has a brief summary of the Creative, Production and Budgeting features and when clicked on takes the user to that feature's information page.

</h2>

### The Account Page

  When clicked on in the Navbar the user's Account page opens. It will show all the user's projects and have a section where they create and purchase new projects.

<h2 align="center">
<img src="documentation/readme-images/home6.png" width="90%">
</h2>

### The Chat page

  This allows users to add and view chats. It also has a link to the profiles page which contains all existing users and the ability for the user to follow them. In doing so the user will create their feed of posts from their followed users. It is intended to build a community for the users of the app where they can share their thoughts and experiences and promote themselves and in return the actual software itself.<br>
  First time and returning users who are trying to find out about the software and deciding whether or not to purchase a product can browse all the Chat messages from users who are already using the software, along with their comments, in the Chat feature. This will give the user a real unfiltered idea about the actual realtime use of the app.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) 

### First Time User Goals

1. #### As a First Time User, I want to learn what the site has to offer and how to navigate the site quickly.

    - The Landing/Home page is split into three sections. The first informs the user as to the nature of the site and what it offers immediately through the image and text used. The text saying offers both an "All in One" Film, TV and Video Production Software platform and the Budgeting Software as a individual product.<br>
    It then lists the software's features headed under the Creative and the Production side. These can be clicked on to take the user quickly to the information page for that feature.<br>
    The second section gives a brief easy to understand overview of what the software does and what it can be used for.<br>
    The site is designed for first time learning. It is streamlined for specific user goal that upon first use the user with a clicks will be able to find all information about the software's features. At the top of every page the Navbar displays all options for the user so they can select their desired destination quickly.

    - The user can login and logout easily from the My Account nav link. The login takes them to Sign In page and the logout is automatic. <br>
    The site also includes a feature that keeps a user signed in for 24 hours so they don't have to go to the trouble of signing in if they are using it regularly. This is achieved by an interceptor function in the CurrentUserContext file that checks, via the utils folder shouldRefreshToken function, if there is a vaild timestamp token in local storage and refreshes it.

3. #### As a Returning User, I want to see what people are saying about the app and know if it is professional and trustworthy.

    - The user can view reviews and testimonials from registered users on the Testimonials page, which is easily accessible from a link in the Navbar. Positive, short and concise lines from these will also be added to the landing page to immediately make an impact on the user.<br>
    The user can also browse all the Chat messages from users who are already using the software, along with their comments, in the Chat feature. This will give the user a real unfiltered idea about the actual real-time use of the app.

4. #### As a Returning User, I want purchase products easily.

    - Once the user has Registered whenever they login their My Account link will display in the Navbar. On going to their Account page the user will immediately see the "Create Project" and "Create Budget" features with a brief summary of each product above it. <br> It also contains a concise explanation of what happens when a product is created and how the user should proceed.
    <br>The Create Project is for the "All in One Platform" and the user can choose which version, the Film, TV or Video/Short production software, best suits their project using the summary above to guide them. The Create Budget is for the Budgeting software. Both the Projects and Budgets will have a discounted student version and the Projects have a one month free trial both of which are designed to create more sales.<br>
    Once the user selects a product they will be taken to the Stripe page to complete the transaction. And once the sale goes through the user will receive an email confirming the purchase and containing the project details. These detail include the Project URL and the user's username and password.<br>
    Lastly the project or Budget will now display on the user's account page with its URL.
