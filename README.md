Which proposed features are buildable?<br>

What features are necessary to make the goods sellable, the shop sellable and in return the actual app sellable to other businesses?<br>

### Structure Plane

The site is structured so the user can navigate in an intuitive way through the different features and categories of products, all pages keeping a uniformed consistency.<br>

The user is taken on a journey into the site, all elements being discoverable as they proceed along. From finding the different categories of cakes and pastries available to adding them to the shopping bag to checking out. To discovering the advantage of creating  an account and the chat other extras available on doing so. The site aims to, through its friendly structure, build a relationship with the user.<br>

The Menu is a key element to the structure. Here the user can feel like they are in a real shop and have a more personal user experience and ease and control over their shopping experience.<br>

The user will see clear states of change when they interact with the features and selection and choice buttons and be given clear feedback to assure them of their interactive success.

The information architecture is a tree structure allowing users to move through content quickly and simply becoming aware of the site’s inherent structure as they go.
