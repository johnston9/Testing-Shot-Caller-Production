<h1 align="center"><strong>Shot Caller Production</strong></h1>

[View the project live here.](https://)

A web application for film, TV and video production.<br>

## Purpose
Essentially the site consists of three elements. The first to introduce the user to it's two software products, one an "All in One Film, TV, and Video Production Platform" and two "Budgeting Software". This element aims to give them about them clear information about the products and encourage them to create an account and purchase them. The second contains the user's account page which allows them to purchase products and view their already purchased ones easily. The third is the actual Budgeting Software. This is available as a seperate product but is also included as part of the "All in One Platform".
<br>

## Usage
To use the site to gather information the user can click on any link in the Home page or Navbar to take them to that feature's information page. <br>
To use the site to view and purchase products the User first creates an account by clicking on any of the Register links then on their Account page they can select and purchase products and view all their already purchased products.<br>
Once a user has purchased an "All in One Platform" they will be given a URL, by email, connecting them to a seperate appliction where the actual software is held along with a username and password for it. The product will also now show in their account page along with the URL to the platform and a seperate link to the product's Budgeting software.<br>
If a user just purchases the Budgeting software they will also receive a URL, by email, for it along with a username and password for it and the product will also now show in their account page along with the URL to it.<br>
More detailed information abote the featire of this site and how o use it can be founf in the [Existing Features section](#existing-features---usage-and-testing)
<br>
There is no installation needed or requirement for the "Allin One Platform" or "Budgeting" software or for this site.<br>

## User Experience (UX)

The business goals are to establish the app as a professional film production software platform, to create an online presence and establish it as a brand. It's primary purpose is to entice new customer to register and purchase products and secure regular returning customers. It aims to initially  to chatch the user's attention by making an immediate impact on the as to the nature of the software and create curiosity with the user to encourage them to explore the software's features, buils trust and ultimatly inspire them to create an account and purchase products. It aspires to build a customer base.

For the user, the initial goal of the site is to find out about the software and register an account easily. Then to create projects by purchasing them. For the regestered user the goal is to access their Account page and view and purchase products..

Ther Home page contains a brief overview of the software's abilities by section, i.e. the different aspects of fim production that it facilitates. Each section when clicked on opens a page detailing and explaining that section with images.

### Strategy Plane

The aim of the site is to introduce Shot Caller Production to it's potential customers.

It aims to create a brand to establish an image in the public eye for the platform, to immediatly impact on them the use and quality of the product. Its elegant bright sophisticated but simple design, clear navigation and easily understood sections aims to encourage customers to explore it's features fully, then create an account and to purchase it's products.

The site aims to, build a relationship with the user through its clear and obvious inherent professional knowledge of the film making process. Making this even clearer by it's breaking down of the process into two sides, the Creative side and the Production side.<br>
One major strategic move was to seperate the Budgeting software available as part of the platform into an individual product. This idea being that user would more readily open to purchase this very necessary tool and seeing its quality be more open to trusting the All in One Platform.

#### Brand Identity
- Brand promise: The most complete film production software on the market.
- Vision: Professional Creativity.
- Mission: To combine the creative and production sides of filmmaking in one all encompasing platform.
- Values: Professional, Creative and Easy to Use.

### Login/Register/Logout Pages and Security

  The user can browse and view the features on the site but they are encouraged to create an account. They can do this or login or logout easily from My Account in the navbar. There are also a number of other links to register, one being on the Home page, and on doing so the user is brought to the Register page which has a personal easy to use feel.<br>
  
  Django Rest Frameworks is used for the backend and has its own register and login features. These include it's inbuilt security measures concerning for registering and logging in and out. it also deals with all other issues like changing and forgetting passwords.<br>
  See [Django Rest Frameworks](documentation/drf) for all Django Rest Frameworks images and testing images.

<p align="center"> <strong>Large Screen</strong></p>
<h2 align="center">
<img src="documentation/readme-images/home6.png" width="90%">
</h2>

  The site has a number of other security measures firstly the use of front end measures to prevent unauthorised users form accessing pages they do not have permisssion to, mainly other users's account pages. <br>
  <br>
  This is achieved firstly in the Front End by an interceptor function in the CurrentUserContext file that checks on each request, via the utils folder shouldRefreshToken function, if there is a vaild timestamp token in local storage and refreshes it. If not it takes the user to the Sign In page.
  Secondly in the DRF backend the views have also a security check to check if the user is authorised to access each page or component.

## Future Features

### Social Account Login
This function allows users to sign up and log in using an existing third party account such as Google and Facebook. This would make encouraging users to sign up easier as they are just a click away and don't have to do any more. For the site owners apart from having more users sregister this opens up huge areas in terms of information and marketing.
